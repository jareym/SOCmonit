Description: SOCmonit is an R toolbox designed to facilitate the preprocessing and modeling of soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction based on spectral data. The package provides a collection of functions and tools for reading, testing, and preprocessing spectral data, as well as creating cross-validation partitions and applying  modeling for SOC prediction. SOCmonit is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners working with remote sensing and soil data analysis. It integrates with other R packages to streamline the analysis workflow and generate comprehensive reports for SOC prediction.
